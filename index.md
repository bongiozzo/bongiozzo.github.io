We believe that
===============

- **Time** is the most important resource to be measured and controlled
- When **goal** is **shared** with someone else you will achieve it easier

So, don't wait any longer - sign a contract for working towards your goal and share it with your goal partner.

## Create new shared goal
```
/newgoal RunEveryDay 1h everyday
/newgoal MoveToHouse 3h every Saturday,Sunday
```
You can improve yourself by running every day and share this goal with your neighbour to run together.
Or, for instance, your family is planning to move to a house, so you can create a contract with yourself to spend time for exploring the right place for the house, searching for good mortgage conditions, etc. This goal can be shared with your wife.


## Join others goals
```
/contract Adidas/RunEveryDay 45min everyday
/contract bongiozzo/sg 1h everyday
```
You can inspire yourself with some public goals from the catalogue - or you can receive a short command for the goal contract from your friend. You can change the contract details like duration and occurency and sign it.


## Commit progress towards the goal
```
/commit sg 90min "Some fixes" "Finish /commit"
```
You should commit your progress every time you've made a specific contract - how much time was spent, what you've done and what you are going to do. SG will highligt the progress for your goal partners nicely. Assure you - they will envy that you're the hero ;)

That's it!
