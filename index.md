We believe that
===============

- **Time** is the most important resource to be measured and controlled
- When **goal** is **shared** with someone else you will gain it easier
- Unifying initiatives should **be free for people - now and forever**

So, don't wait any longer - sign contract for working towards your goal and share it with your goal's partner.

## Create new shared goal
```
/newgoal RunEveryDay 1h everyday
/newgoal MoveToHouse 3h every saturday,sunday
```
You can improve yourself by running everyday and share this goal with your neighbour to run together.
Or, for instance, your family is planning to move to the house, so you can create a contract with yourself to spend the time for exploring the right place for the house, searching for good mortgage conditions, etc. This goal can be shared with your wife.


## Join others goals
```
/contract Adidas/RunEveryDay 45min everyday
/contract bongiozzo/sg 1h everyday
```
You can inspire yourself with some public goals from the catalogue - or you can receive a short command for the goal's contract from your friend. You can change the contract details like duration and occurency and sign it.


## Commit progress towards the goal
```
/commit sg 90min "Some fixes" "Finish /commit"
```
You should commit your progress every time you've made a specific contract - how much time was spent, what you've done and what you are going to do. SG will highligt the progress for your goal's partners nicely. Assure you - they will envy that you're hero ;)

That's it!
